# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Behavior Bug
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to the unexpected behavior when using multiple hover and focus states.  The problem is that the order of the classes and their specificity can lead to unexpected rendering results where one state might override another unexpectedly.

## Problem
In some cases, when you apply multiple hover and focus states to an element, the final rendered style may not be what you would expect.  The order of the classes in your HTML and their specificity within Tailwind's styling system can cause conflicts. 

## Solution
One way to solve this problem is to use the `@apply` directive or utilize a more specific class structure to ensure the correct order of precedence.  Another approach is to meticulously check for cascading conflicts in your styles.
