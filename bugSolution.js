```javascript
// Solution using @apply directive to manage class order and specificity
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:\@apply bg-blue-700 focus:\@apply bg-green-500">
  This is a div with multiple hover and focus states.
</div>

//Or  using more specific classes to avoid the conflict
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 focus:bg-green-500">
  <div class="hover:bg-blue-700 focus:bg-green-500">
  This is a div with multiple hover and focus states.
</div>
```
